Installation instructions
-------------------------

Arbiter uses the waf build system, and has the following dependencies:

 - MCS >= 2.6.4
 - GLib# >= 2.12
 - GTK# >= 2.12
 - Glade# >= 2.12
 
To configure and build Arbiter, use these commands:

 ./waf configure
 ./waf build

You can't "install" it in traditional terms, but you can create redistributable binary archives for all three platforms at once using the bindist command:

 ./waf bindist
