Installation instructions
-------------------------

Arbiter uses the waf build system, and has the following dependencies:

 - MCS >= 2.6.4
 - GLib# >= 2.12
 - GTK# >= 2.12
 - Glade# >= 2.12
 
To configure and build Arbiter, use these commands:

 ./waf configure

You can't "install" it in traditional terms yet; this functionality will be available next release.
